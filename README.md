Amazon Web Scraper Project - In this project I scraped data from Amazon using BeautifulSoup and Requests. The purpose was to implement an Amazon price tracker. 
It scrapes product details like title and price, then saves the data to a CSV file. The program results in automated daily price checks and appends new data to the CSV, thus ensuring continuous price change monitoring.

Data Cleaning World Layoffs - In this project I cleaned a dataset containing global layoff information. It contained details, such as company names, layoff dates, number of layoffs, and countries. 
The main goal of this project is to ensure accuracy and consistency in order to draw reliable insights from this dataset. This was completed by removing duplicates, standardizing the data, removing null values, and removing unnecessary columns.

Exploratory Analysis World Layoffs - Conducted a comprehensive exploratory analysis on a dataset that involved global layoffs. The focus was on analyzing maximum layoff percentages, while also checking which companies and industries resulted in the highest layoffs. 
Furthermore, the analysis ranked the top five companies with the highest layoffs each year. Thus, these insights help to understand patterns and significant factors related to layoffs within the dataset.

Movie Correlation Project - In this project I checked for correlations related to highest gross earnings. Therefore, the project looked at various features such as budget, gross revenue, and other factors. 
Additionally, it involved importing necessary libraries, loading the dataset, and performing data cleaning, including handling missing values and converting data types. 
Key visualizations and statistical methods are utilized to uncover correlations between movie budgets and gross revenue, providing insights into factors influencing movie success. 
Thus, the findings were that 'votes' and 'budget' had the highest correlation in relation to gross earnings.

Bike Buyers Dashboard -In my analysis of the bike buyers dataset, I uncovered some interesting trends about who buys bikes and why. By looking at data from over 18,000 individuals, I found that higher income levels and professional jobs are strong indicators of bike purchases. 
There are also notable differences based on gender, marital status, and commute distance. For example, people living closer to work are more likely to buy a bike. 
These insights provide a clear picture of the factors that influence bike buying decisions, offering valuable information for targeting potential customers.

Power BI Project Data Professional - This Power BI project delves into the insights from a survey of 630 data professionals from around the world, with a focus on the US, India, and Canada. 
The dashboard reveals some interesting trends, like data scientists earning the highest average salaries among the different job titles surveyed. It also highlights that Python is the top choice for programming languages, with over 400 users. 
The average age of participants is just under 30, there is a mix of experience, but the majority faced moderate challenge in breaking into the data field. Satisfaction levels with work-life balance and salary are also visualized, showing averages of 5.74 and 4.27 out of 10. 
Furthermore, this project gives a general view of how data professionals feel about their careers.
